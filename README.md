## Overview

Dental caries remain one of the most prevalent oral diseases worldwide and are closely associated with oral pain, infection, and reduced quality of life. Early identification of suspicious carious regions is clinically important, yet manual examination from images is time-consuming and depends heavily on professional expertise.

To explore the feasibility of AI-assisted dental diagnosis, DentVision evaluates multiple YOLO-based object detection models for automated cavity detection in intraoral photographs. The project focuses on a lightweight and reproducible workflow that can be further extended for intelligent oral screening applications.
